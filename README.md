# Karius Inc.

## Mission 
Karius is a life sciences company that envisions a world where infectious diseases are no longer a major threat to the human health. We advance diagnostic science and technology in order to deliver breakthroughs and upgrade the standard of care in the fight against infectious disease.

## Product
The Karius Testâ„¢ is a liquid biopsy for infectious diseases that can free clinicians from the diagnostic maze so they can return patients back to health quickly and safely.
From a single blood sample, the Karius Test can non-invasively and rapidly detect over 1000 pathogens causing both deep-seated and bloodstream infections. The Karius Test helps clinicians avoid invasive, low-yield, and sequential diagnostic tests that can delay treatment for the most vulnerable hospitalized patients.
